TGK-MatchThree
==============

Simple match three game using Unity

This project built for Tinker's Game Kit project. I choose "match three" game theme because it would be challenging, haha.

In this project I implemented the delegate, and object pooling.

Basic features on this game are:
- Movement (click first node, click second node)
- Score
- Combo
- Minimum occurrence number
- Set type and image of shown nodes
- Check whether there will be any movement
- Show hint
